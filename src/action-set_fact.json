Variables created with set_fact have different precedence depending on whether they are or are not cached.\nPer the standard Ansible variable precedence rules, many other types of variables have a higher priority, so this value may be overridden.\nThis module is also supported for Windows targets.",

This creates a possibly confusing interaction with C(meta: clear_facts) as it will remove the 'ansible_fact' but not the host variable."
